## Course Philosophy

We seek to develop ways of evaluating how civic technology impacts a whole community.
Digital governance, approached through the lens of equity, could empower groups who've been excluded from policy making, service provision, or community redevelopment.
The study and practice of digital governance should be the study and practice of how technical tools - in and out of the civic sector - impact equity and inclusion.
