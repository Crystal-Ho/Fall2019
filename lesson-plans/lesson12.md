- 49% of US online commerce happens on Amazon
- Classic monopoly problems, like terrible worker conditions
- It is hard to define everything a tech company controls
- Amazon gets all data about what is sold on its platform
- Amazon is able to use AWS to subsidize the other failing parts of its business

    - AWS benefits from scale in an almost unprecedented way
