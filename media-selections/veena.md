> There seems to be a huge disconnect between policy and technology, where those in Big Tech do not understand the importance of policy
and those working on policy do not understand how emerging tech works. I do not want to be in either of those categories. 

<h3> Class Three - Algorithmic Bias </h3> 

[Flawed Algorithms are grading millions of students' essays](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7dj9/flawed-algorithms-are-grading-millions-of-students-essays?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=76444586&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86J-dM6Yg6jGk3q5m9vpYEAWrt3HONfUloyHgL-gTruZWIgXddqop4Ik21u9kb8gEFegK8xbtfTKquojndZL5W1erjHg&_hsmi=76444586)

Several companies that sell standardized tests are using NLPs to assess critical
writing skills; however, Vice Motherboard found that these programs show significant
bias against those who speak English as a second-language (usually minority populations.)
Additionally, these models gave better scores who used "larger" vocabulary, even if
it did not mean anything in context. 21 states use NLPs to grade these standardized
tests in public schools.

Almost every university and school uses standardized testing to determine success
for millions of students. These models could be preventing access to rightfully-
earned opportunities. 

<h3> Class Three - Algorithmic Bias </h3> 

[Humane Tech Podcast: With Great Power comes... no responsibility?](https://humanetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CHT-Undivided-Attention-Podcast-Ep.3-With-Great-Power...Transcript.pdf)
<br> 
In the podcast, Yael Einstat, a former CIA officer, discussed the importance of government 
regulation of tech companies. The discussion was not necessarily "if" tech should be 
regulated, but "how." Due to [CDA 230](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230), which is a piece of legislation written 
in the 90s, regulating tech has been a polarizing issue-- does regulation infringe upon free speech? 
<br> 

> That is my favorite line because the way I look at it is, a better way to look at
CDA 230 is, I actually don't want Facebook and Google and Twitter to be regulated the 
same way as the New York Times...I say, figure out what they are, which is a digital 
curator or digital amplifier or whatever term you want. 

<br> 
Facebook, and other Big Tech companies, have been pushing the responsibility of regulation
onto others, stating that providing proper safety precautions is "too difficult." However,
we need to hold these companies responsible, so better technologies can be built. Einstat 
argues that Big Tech prevents better (more responsibly handled) tech from being made.
