### Class 2 - Algorithmic Bias

[Flawed Algorithms Are Grading Millions of Students' Essays](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7dj9/flawed-algorithms-are-grading-millions-of-students-essays)

Media Justification: This article discusses how essay-scoring engines are subject to the human bias present in the AI training sets. Because the human graders often project their subconscious bias on the essays they grade, the AI scoring machines not only pick up the bias, but amplify it when they begin grading essays. This article complemented the other two articles on AI bias for the week (bias in sentencing and hiring) nicely, because they all emphasize the striking prevalence of AI bias nowadays. It seems as if we won't be able to escape the bias without a creative solution, as mentioned in one of the other articles.
