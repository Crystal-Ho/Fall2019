I am taking this class because I am interested in how the growth of technology and our increasing dependence on it can (or cannot) be regulated by government policy. 


### Class 1 - Content Moderation on the Internet

[Is Social Media Content Moderation Impossible](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2018/09/08/is-social-media-content-moderation-an-impossible-task/#45957d115fa8)

Media Justification: This article relates to the week’s topic of content moderation and free speech because it discusses the difficulty of establishing a common set of rules for moderation of online content in a global setting. Because social media sites and other online platforms operate worldwide, the content they curate must be deemed socially and culturally acceptable in all countries – a great challenge because many eastern countries have not adopted the western beliefs of free speech. The article also touches on how even if a post is taken down from its country of origin, it can still be accessed through sites such as Wikileaks and never truly disappears online. 

Class 2 - Algorithmic Bias

[TED Institute - Can we protect AI from our biases?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV_tx4ngVT0)

Media Justification: This video from TED institute discusses how humans are inherently biased (can be good or bad) and how our biases translate into algorithms unconsciously. Robin Hauser, the speaker, mentions examples of AI that were left to learn from biased online sources such as Twitter (Microsoft’s TayTweets) and Urban Dictionary (IBM’s Watson) and within a few hours the machines also echoed those views. The media selection relates to this week’s topic of algorithmic bias because it highlights the ways our own biases seep into programs and warns that we must combat the issue now before it’s too late for the AI to unlearn it.
