Media Justification: This article relates to the week’s topic of content moderation and free speech because it discusses the difficulty of establishing a common set of rules for moderation of online content in a global setting. Because social media sites and other online platforms operate worldwide, the content they curate must be deemed socially and culturally acceptable in all countries – a great challenge because many eastern countries have not adopted the western beliefs of free speech. The article also touches on how even if a post is taken down from its country of origin, it can still be accessed through sites such as Wikileaks and never truly disappears online. 

Class 2 - Topic
