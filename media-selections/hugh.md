Political and Social Thought, Class of 2021

> I've long believed in the power of technology to transform society for the better, although for many years I believed that *technology alone* would be enough. In hindsight, such a view was naive and dangerous. Much of my interest today is rooted in leveraging the very best technology has to offer us in an intentional, thoughtful manner while mitigating negative side effects, all in the interest of the public good. With all this in mind, I'm very excited for this semester of Gov Lab!
