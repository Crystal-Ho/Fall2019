Field of Study, Year: CS and Linguistics - 3rd Year

> I'm taking this class because I think that computer scientists are trained for efficiency, not ethics. I want to learn the adverse effects of technology so I don't contribute to the problem and so I can advocate for more critical thinking in the field.


### Class 1 - Topic

[YouTube’s arbitrary standards: Stars keep making money even after breaking the rules](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/09/youtubes-arbitrary-standards-stars-keep-making-money-even-after-breaking-rules/?noredirect=on)

Media Justification: This week's topic reminded me of the Logan Paul Youtube scandal from this past year, so I looked for an article about it. This Washington Post article details the perspective of moderators at Youtube who have noticed Youtube's unfair content moderation rules. It explains that the lack of equality mostly surrounds issues with money and advertising: the main things that social media platforms are concerned with. One moderator wrote “Our responsibility was never to the creators or to the users — it was to the advertisers" - which should have been included in the list of problems with content moderation article. 

### Class 2 - Topic

[AI-powered cameras become new tool against mass shootings](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-04/ai-powered-cameras-become-new-tool-against-mass-shootings)

Media Justification: This article, to me, is so ridiculous. We have resorted to artificial intelligence, which is just a lot of matrix math, to identify and "stop" school shooters. "Intelligent video" is supposed to be able to identify not only weapons, but "violent" facial expressions. I'm not sure what this even means, and overall, it's avoiding the main issue, which is that Americans have very easy access to guns. Also, data-driven racism could make this technology go horribly wrong. For some reason, we really have trouble identifying the root cause of problems, and at the same time put so much trust in this non-sentient body.
