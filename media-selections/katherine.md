Field of Study, Year: CS and Linguistics - 3rd Year

> I'm taking this class because I think that computer scientists are trained for efficiency, not ethics. I want to learn the adverse effects of technology so I don't contribute to the problem and so I can advocate for more critical thinking in the field.


### Class 1 - Content Moderation (free speech restrictions) on the Internet

[YouTube’s arbitrary standards: Stars keep making money even after breaking the rules](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/09/youtubes-arbitrary-standards-stars-keep-making-money-even-after-breaking-rules/?noredirect=on)

Media Justification: This week's topic reminded me of the Logan Paul Youtube scandal from this past year, so I looked for an article about it. This Washington Post article details the perspective of moderators at Youtube who have noticed Youtube's unfair content moderation rules. It explains that the lack of equality mostly surrounds issues with money and advertising: the main things that social media platforms are concerned with. One moderator wrote “Our responsibility was never to the creators or to the users — it was to the advertisers" - which should have been included in the list of problems with content moderation article. 

### Class 2 - Algorithmic Bias

[AI-powered cameras become new tool against mass shootings](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-04/ai-powered-cameras-become-new-tool-against-mass-shootings)

Media Justification: This article, to me, is so ridiculous. We have resorted to artificial intelligence, which is just a lot of matrix math, to identify and "stop" school shooters. "Intelligent video" is supposed to be able to identify not only weapons, but "violent" facial expressions. I'm not sure what this even means, and overall, it's avoiding the main issue, which is that Americans have very easy access to guns. Also, data-driven racism could make this technology go horribly wrong. For some reason, we really have trouble identifying the root cause of problems, and at the same time put so much trust in non-sentient bodies (computers and guns!).

### Class 3 - Regulating Tech Monopolies

[Adam Ruins Everything - How the Government Created Tech Monopolies | truTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mid1VvK9Xpgs)

[Please Regulate Us: Tech Firms Need More Regulation](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/please-regulate-us/597613/)

This short Adam Ruins Everything clip reveals a small part of the relationship between government and tech companies that I have never really considered. The concept that tech companies exist outside of the public sphere is false; according to this video, the US government invested $4.5 million in Google and a half a billion dollars in Tesla to help them begin. Despite this, Adam points out that these companies don't pay the taxes they should, and therefore have a less reciprocal relationship with the govenment. In the Atlantic article, the author (president of Microsoft, Brad Smith), points out that "Many in tech circles have asserted that people in government don’t understand enough about technology to regulate it properly—even while tech companies have benefited from all manner of government funding and support." In my opinion, by accepting government funding, you acknowledge that you have an obligation to the government. The government should be expected to regulate these companies as they are not separate actors. On another note, it's interesting that the President of Microsoft wrote this article, but it makes sense at the end of the article. He ends with the statement, "Technology innovation is not going to slow down. The work to manage it needs to speed up," placing the responsibility on regulators, rather than innovators.
